What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Why should you have different branches?
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

1. Gitignore file provides a way to ignore unwanted files and extensions from being tracked by the git repository. In a java project, .project, .class and target folders must be ignored as they are not source code and should be generated locally.


2. Fast-forward in Git means that the git was able to merge two different files automatically without any merge conflict.


3. Different branches allows development teams to develop different features simultaneously. Every feature must have a different branch for it. This makes sure the head of master branch is not updated too often, but rather only updated when a ready to be tested feature is merged into it.


4. In a project  we can have multiple remote git repositories but it starts with "Origin".
